## Prerequisites

1. We will provide a cloud-base RStudio environment with everything pre-installed and datasets in place. We'll give you a URL and a login on the day and you'll only need a laptop with a web browser and ability to get on wifi.
2. All of the models we're building will work on a laptop so if you want to follow along on your own machine then please follow the steps below:

Install the following R packages from CRAN in the usual way: "tidyverse", "caret", "keras"

Installing Keras requires Python dependencies:
$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3 1
$ sudo apt install -y python-pip python-virtualenv

In an R session install the keras/tensorflow python libraries by running:
library(keras)
install_keras()





What is deep learning

feataures (inputs) - try to go wide
transformed features - turn inputs into something more representative and useful to predictive modeling
algo to munch the features
target (output)

need to learn how to 1) feature transform and 2) build the algo

DL good for:
  - unstructured data, where features are learned rather than designed
    head of kaggle said ML better/winning on structured data
  - big data - needs lots of data
  - familiar - trained networks can be used on new problems

Neural Networks

nodes (neurons) & edges
nodes are built up in horizontal layers, contain values
edges are weighted, feeding values from one layer to next, usually aggregating in next layer
input layer -> thru hidden layers (increasingly abstracted) -> to the output layer

Iris Neural Network

4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal width, petal length
1 target: species (setosa, versicolo, )

TensorFlow -> turns models/equations into numerical solvers doing the heavy linalg, via transofmration into a graph structure
  not only for neural networks, general numerical solver

R and TensorFlow
  tensorflow.rstudio.com
  reticulate package
  not much overhead to bring up python when installing TF

Keras
  keras.rstudio.com
  higher leval on top of TF, specifically for neural networks

Deep Learning with R (Francois Challet)


How it all fits together

We will write against Keras in R
Keras will turn that into NN math
TensorFlow receives math from Keras to compute
