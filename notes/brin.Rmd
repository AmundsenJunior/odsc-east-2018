- What are the critical applications of data visualization throughout the data science workflow?
- When is specifically data visualization a good choice?
- How not to lie with data visualization

## Key applications in the data science workflow
- Data science process
    - The purpose of visualization here is to know how to move thru process and use the tools
    - Apply statistics appropriately
        - Look at data to know whether lm is actually appropriate to apply to the data
- Choosing model parameters 
    - Heatmap of parameter grid search might show that range of parameters should be changed
- data science insight - be able to present info/patterns visible and interpretable to analysts
- data science communication - making wide audience accessible, provide context with outside data sources

## When is data vis a good choise (tufte: drive-by guidance)

- Data visualization is communication.
- Is your purpose to communicate individual numbers or a pattern?
- When looking at one or two numbers - data visualization is unnecessary
- If you want to comm specific values, Showing viz obscures via showing only trends

## The imporance of integrity (how not to lie)

- In its best form, data viz enhances understanding
- In its worst form, data viz can obscure the truth or even lie
- How plot parameters influence interpretation
    - Axis scale range affects interpretability
    - Consider that when doing EDA and accepting default settings in your tools
    - No reason to use line graphs for categorical variables, which may include a non-continuous range of numerical values
- How choice of color influences interpretation
    - How we perceive color and color relationships
    - Integral to how perceive patterns and interpret them
    - Hue
        - Color wheel
    - Value
        - Lightness or darkness - difference from black to white
    - Intensity
        - Saturation
        - Difference from gray
    - Color indicates categories
        - Hue similarity can imply closeness, even when they are not
    - Color representing numerical value
        - Use color gradients carefully that doesn't obscure variance or most data existing in a small value range versus outliers

## Conclusion

1. Would visualization help you understand/explore your data or proecess?
1. How do the parameters of this visualization drive its interpretation?
