## Notes

_"Always be yourself, unless you can be a unicorn, then always be a unicorn."_
Reference image: The cat riding a fire-breathing unicorn with gun.

- _Invasion of the Body Snatchers_ - _Harvard Business Review_ ("Sexiest Job of 21st Century") 
    - Who are these people living among us that can do these incredible things?
- The Jeff Goldblum era of data science (2004-15)
    - MapReduce -> Hadoop -> data science venn diagram (meant to describe the discipline, not the person) -> Watson -> NYU DS MS offered -> Gartner drops big data from hype review
- Be Dr. Satler in Jurassic Park - the optimistic skeptic
    - Don't be like the Fly, be like Vice Admiral Hodo

- The best possible interview sets up the interviewee to succeed, and the interviewer can witness it
    - Your interview is a product of your team's culture
    - Transparency is extremely valuable at every step of the process
    - Heavily asymmetrical interview processes hurt you 
        - The process should make both sides feel like they will be successful at the company

- Process at Alluvium
    - Pre-interview
        - Write a specific job requirement for what you really need help with
        - Provide a take-home exercise that directly reflects the work you do (e.g. set up a streaming service for interviewees to code against)
        - Phone screen out candidates that won't likely be successful with take-home
        - Send and review take-home as part of your process (e.g. exercise is a github repo, and take-home submission is a PR)
    - Interview
        - Meeting 1 - Code review of take-home to understand their thought process
        - Meeting 2 - Project planning around the take-home prototype solution to a real problem you have
        - Meeting 3 - Project discovery w/candidate to understand how they would develop this to go to production
        - Meeting 4 - Company values discussion
            - Have them rank and discuss importance
    - Post-interview
        - if need more information, schedule another call
        - Consensus no-hire
            - Why have we gotten to this point? have a post-mortem
        - Consensus hire
