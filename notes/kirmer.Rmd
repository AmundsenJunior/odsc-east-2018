_"it's so easy, you just..."_ is not coming from her - there will be parts of the R package process that will be hard/challenging

problem: data science teams without structured, intentional collaboration leak knowledge and waste resources
  - code you can't replicate
  - results you can't replicate
solution: build your team's culture, infrastructure, and tools so that build, retaining, and sharing knowledge is easy and valued.
  r packages a re a great tool to help you get there

## Example Package

github.com/uptakeopensource/uptasticsearch - using elasticsearch databases with R
  was a thorny problem of connecting to and querying elasticsearch to get ES data into an R dataframe
  instead of creating a set of reusable snippets internally, team built an R pkg open to internal contributions & improvements, then open sourced for more contributions

## Why use R packages?
  improve quality and reproducibility by using peer-reviewed, validated tools in package form
    - rewriting code is an opportunity for mistakes
    - providing a systemic means to saving and sharing reusable code, beyond snippets
    - you can write the tools that you wish existed for what you need to repeatedly use in your business
  you can use packages for providing tools to other areas of the business, not just other data scientists
    - reporting tools for c-suite
    - visualization template for BI/sales
    - data etl process for data engrs
    empower your colleagues to do routine work, and free up data science to do the complex and innovative projects
      sounds a lot like devops automating routine tasks and requests to elevate work to working on more complex problems
  packages codify institutional/tribal/personal knowledge
    - enables new data scientists to spin up and contribute faster
    - prevent brain drain
    Community tools increase the stability of your team for the long term
  move towards a culture of education across your organization
    develop internal learning
      working sessions & tech talks
    increase data science visibility
      interact w/non-ds colleagues
      adding value and insights
    prime ds team to contribute to open source generally

A group of individual data scientists is not necessarily a collaborative team of data scientists
  need a culture of working together towards same goals and trust to share knowledge before just putting a need for creating R packages on their workload
Leadership should also encourage and incentivize such efforts to help make them successful in relation to their internal importance

Planning
  explore undocumented resources
    investigate existing best practices
    aggregate your institutional knowledge

Packages need documentation
 - comment code
 - help docs
 - vignettes
 - package level descriptive documents
 - websites via pkgdown (pkgdown.r-lib.org)


## Tutorial - Building a simple R package

video available with howto link on repo
github.com/skirmer/r_packages HOWTO on making packages

use devtools and roxygen2

create new project > package type > add functions and data you want included
  functions get added to the R/ directory of the project
  store data into a data/ subdirectory
  in Rstudio R package structure, can insert roxygen skeleton for documentation
  edit the DESCRIPTION file - including license and dependencies

Documentation
  devtools::document() - creates .Rd files for package documentation, into the man/ directory

Vignettes
  devtools::use_vignette("GettingStarted") - nice to have long-form documentation - RMarkdown file, into the vignettes/ directory

Unit Tests
  into the tests/ directory
  setup file - use the 'testthat' library, save as testthat.R
  into the tests/testthat/ directory
    add the test files

Build the package
  devtools:;build() - creates a tarball file
  devtools:;build_vignettes()

Install the package
  devtools::install()

Review docs in RStudio of installed package

Build the doc site with pkgdown
  pkgdown::build_site()

Varsity-level steps for R packages in organizations
  CI for building and testing packages with multiple contributors
  Internal CRAN repo
    so that install.packages() can be
