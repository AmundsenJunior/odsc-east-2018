_"it's so easy, you just..."_

- This is not coming from her. There will be parts of the R package process that will be hard and/or challenging.

#### Problem
- Data science teams without structured, intentional collaboration leak knowledge and waste resources.  
    - Code you can't replicate
    - Results you can't replicate

#### Solution
- Build your team's culture, infrastructure, and tools so that build, retaining, and sharing knowledge is easy and valued.  
    - R packages are a great tool to help you get there.

#### Example Package: [Upstasticsearch](https://github.com/uptakeopensource/uptasticsearch) 
- Package for connecting to Elasticsearch databases with R
- Their data science team had a thorny, persistent problem of connecting to and querying Elasticsearch in order to get ES data into an R dataframe.
- Instead of creating a set of reusable snippets internally, the team built an R package open to internal contributions & improvements, then open sourced for more contributions.

## Why use R packages?
- Improve quality and reproducibility by using peer-reviewed, validated tools in package form
    - Rewriting code is an opportunity for mistakes
    - Providing a systemic means to saving and sharing reusable code, beyond snippets
    - You can write the tools that you wish existed for what you need to repeatedly use in your business
- You can use packages for providing tools to other areas of the business, not just other data scientists
    - Reporting tools for c-suite
    - Visualization template for BI/sales
    - Data etl process for data engrs
- Empower your colleagues to do routine work, and free up data science to do the complex and innovative projects
    - Sounds a lot like devops automating routine tasks and requests to elevate work to working on more complex problems
- Packages codify institutional/tribal/personal knowledge
    - Enables new data scientists to spin up and contribute faster
    - Prevent brain drain
- Community tools increase the stability of your team for the long term
- Move towards a culture of education across your organization
- Develop internal learning
    - Working sessions & tech talks
- Increase data science visibility
    - Interact w/non-ds colleagues
    - Adding value and insights
- Prime ds team to contribute to open source generally

_"A group of individual data scientists is not necessarily a collaborative team of data scientists."_

- Need a culture of working together towards same goals and trust to share knowledge before just putting a need for creating R packages on their workload
- Leadership should also encourage and incentivize such efforts to help make them successful in relation to their internal importance

### Planning
- Explore undocumented resources
- Investigate existing best practices
- Aggregate your institutional knowledge

### Packages need documentation
- Comment code
- Help docs
- Vignettes
- Package level descriptive documents
- Websites via pkgdown (pkgdown.r-lib.org)

#### Package Creation Dependencies
- `devtools`
- `roxygen2`
- `testthat`
- `pkgdown`

#### Create New Project
- Create new project > package type
- Add functions and data you want included
- Functions get added to the `R/` directory of the project
- Store data into a `data/` subdirectory
- In Rstudio R package structure, can insert `roxygen` skeleton for documentation
- Edit the `DESCRIPTION` file, including license and dependencies

#### Documentation
- Creates `.Rd` files for package documentation
- From `*.R` files function comments based on `roxygen` skeleton
- Into the `man/` directory

    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    devtools::document() 
    ```

#### Vignettes
- Nice to have long-form documentation 
- RMarkdown file into the `vignettes/` directory

    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    devtools::use_vignette("GettingStarted") 
    ```

#### Unit Tests
- Use the `testthat` library
- Into the `tests/` directory
    - Setup file: save as `testthat.R`
- Into the `tests/testthat/` directory
    - Add the `test-*.R` files

#### Build Package
- Two steps to build the package and build vignettes separately.

    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    devtools::build() # creates a tarball file
    devtools::build_vignettes()
    ```

#### Install Package
- This installs the package into local RStudio environment, making it accessible for loading into other projects.

    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    devtools::install()
    ```

#### Build the doc site with pkgdown
- Generate a static HTML site of package documentation.

    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    pkgdown::build_site()
    ```

## Conclusion

- Varsity-level steps for R packages in organizations
    - CI for building and testing packages with multiple contributors
    - Internal CRAN repo
        - So that install.packages() can be
