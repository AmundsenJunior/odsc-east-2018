```

<div class='notes'>
- This shows the distribution of prices
- These notes store into speaker notes section
- Open the 'presentation.html?presentme=true' file, and hit the warning about popups
- Then refresh the page, and a popup should come up
- That popup, if you press 'P' it will run synchronized in presentation mode, with the popup showing notes and other page just showing the slides
