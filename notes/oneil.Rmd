***

- Mathematical authority in data science obscures model subjectivity
- WMDs are __widespread__, __mysterious__, and __destructive__
    - Value-added model for teacher evaluation
    - Personality test screens for mental illness
- Models are defined by their (good or bad) data
    - Hiring algorithm in a company culture of sexual harassment and bias excludes women applicants as not likely successful
    - Predictive policing uses historical arrests (not crime) data, targets heavily policed areas
- Hippocratic oath for data science
    - Have someone's legal, human, or constitutional rights been violated?

## Notes

- Data scientists use mathematical authority to shield the subjectivity of their models
- Power as data scientists to choose the definition of success

__WMDs__ - _Widespread, Mysterious, Destructive_

- Teacher value-added model is destructive
- Specific algorithm for personality test that screens mental illness used generally excludes whole sub-populations from jobs
- An algorithm uses past experiences/history to define a model for success in the future
    - Suppose Fox News wanted a ML hiring algorithm, when the culture is one of sexual harassment and biased
    - Women applicants would be excluded as not likely to be successful
- Predictive policing is biased, by past crimes (data is actually arrests) determining where future crimes are likely to be found
    - Predictive policing is just predicting the police
- Take a Hippocratic oath for data science: consider whether someone's legal, human, or constitutional rights have been violated
- Democracy thrives on inefficiency, on everyone knowing about everyone
    - Not being targeted by efficient unfair and exploitative methods of voter suppression on Facebook
- Need a data science bill of rights, an FDA for algorithms
