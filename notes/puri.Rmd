***

- Enterprise AI is not about classifying cats versus dogs images
- Enterprise AI has very narrow, deep domains of problems to answer
- Key problems are in machine teaching and learning with small data, not big
- Requires knowledge of the enterprise to pose right questions that can't be answered by consumer AI applications

## Notes

- Journey from consumer AI to enterprise AI
- Enterprise AI is not about labeling images/captioning images (Microsoft coco captioning challenge)
- Crowdsourced solving (e.g. imagenet) are not enterprise AI-compatible
    - Enterprise AI have very narrow deep domains of problems to answer
- Enterprise AI: machine teaching and learning with small data
    - Show a baby one picture of a cat multiple times (not hundreds of different cat pictures), til one day they can identify any cat
- Knowledge & language of the enterprise
    - Is not a cats v dogs problem
    - It's about how do you read millions/trillions of pdfs (pixelated images of text/table/formula/image data) and get ai to tap into that
- Current methods can't reason without large sets of carefully-labeled data
