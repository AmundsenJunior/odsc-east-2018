A big gap in data science is not in the technical tools available, but in the ability to package the story for stakeholders that they can understand and act upon.

## Keys to Data Storytelling
1. Audience
    - Every story needs a hero, and a data story's hero is the audience
    - Audience determines what design choices are made
        - Who they are 
        - What they need to know
2. Data
    - Sourcing, aggregating, and choosing the right metrics for the audience
    - Metrics shouldn't be complicated; they should be chosen as appropriate for the audience
3. Visuals
    - Sometimes a table is the only thing necessary
    - Sometimes impact metrics are only necessary (big font of stat)
    - When a chart is needed, choosing the right chart is key
4. Narrative
    - Weaving all the elements together with a story

## The gestalt laws of visual perception
    - _The Law of Proximity_
        - Closeness helps define similarity or relative connection
        - This is an instant perception
    - _The Law of Similarity_
        - The same color connects items even if not by proximity
    - _The Law of Enclosure_
        - Grouping by boundary definitions makes clear what's part of a group

## Ranking of elementary perceptual tasks
- More accurate to less accurate
- Position
    - On a common scale
    - On on-aligned scales
- Length
    - From the same baseline
    - From different baselines
- Size
    - Comparison of different areas
    - Comparison of different volumes

## Conclusion

In data storytelling - not dashboard analytics visualizations - choose colors that add to the story, and consider that not all data is a main character (gray out background data).
