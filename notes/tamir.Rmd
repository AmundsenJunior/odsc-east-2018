## Fake News Problem
- I want to know what's being communicated is true
- The quicker we can share and verify/validate knowledge, the quicker we get to the truth
- By greasing the wheels of information sharing, you also grease the wheels of misinformation sharing

- Can't detect truth easily, and blocking fake news can amount to censorship
    - Instead, look for presence of "Increased emotional content negatively impacts cognitive function"
    - Mary poppins: "Practically perfect people never permit sentiment to muddle their thinking."
    - Emotional content is manipulative, and has been exploited by actors

- Solving 'fake news' means
    - Enable readers to deterct when the article's goal is to be emotionally manipulative
    - Enable cognitive engagement, alert and prevent manipulated emotional reaction

## Solving the problem
- Algorithm does not look at URL/Source metadata
- `word2vec`: algorithm (n-gram ANN classifier) - transfer learning trick to put similar words in a geometry space to set relationships
    - `king - man + woman = queen`
    - `england - london + paris = france`
    - `microsoft - nadella + zuckerberg = facebook`
